# UI Project 4 Hadoop API

## Project..

It was a project I was commisioned to do as an UI that would control a set of API commands in a Hadoop closter.
The application was able to monitor active jobs and keep a list of completed jobs.
It was also able to execute pre-configured python with the needed paramenteer that the user would add when creating the job.
The project was abandoned due to funding issues.

**Disclaimer..** The specs/requirement of this project kept changing almost every 10 days (or less) so the code is a bit _messy_
